# Generating-syntax-fig-for-latex

Reduces the tedious task of copying and pasting \includegraphics a lot of time (for the number of images we 
use in the report) by a very basic python code.


Takes 1 argument of the path of the folder containing images to be uploaded on latex and generates text file for the 
corresponding syntax needed in latex and saves the text file in the same folder.


**Customize the fwrite part of the script as per your need such as:**
1.Adjust the height and width of image before running the script.
2.Add in caption and label syntax if you want to beforehand.

**Make sure the folder does not contain anything other than the images.**

*Also found this bash script which uploads files to overleaf:*
